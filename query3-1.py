# Query: Customers search for the most expensive product within a specific price range among a fixed category of goods, displaying its current inventory status. If sufficient inventory is available, the product is added to the shopping cart. 
# The shopping cart is updated with the product details, quantity, and total price, while the system marks the historical purchase record. Finally, the product inventory is updated to reflect the purchase.

# Description of the Query
# The query implements the following process for a customer to find and purchase a product:
# Finding the Product:
# The customer searches for the most expensive product of a specific type (book) within a given price range (150-200) from the Products collection. The product with the highest price in this range is identified and selected.

# Checking Current Inventory:
# The current inventory of the selected product is retrieved from the Inventory collection. If the stock is less than the requested quantity, the process stops, and the available stock is displayed.
# If the stock is sufficient, the process proceeds to the next step.

# Adding to Cart:
# The selected product is added to the customerâ€™s cart. If the product is already present in the cart, the quantity is updated.
# The cart's total price is recalculated based on the product price and quantity. The updated cart information is stored in the Customers collection.

# Marking Purchase History:
# The system checks the PastOrders collection to mark whether the customer has purchased this product before. This information is included in the response for analytics and historical tracking.

# Updating Inventory:
# The Inventory collection is updated to reduce the stock of the selected product by the purchased quantity. Real-time inventory synchronization ensures accuracy for future queries.
# Result:
# If successful, the system returns details of the selected product, the updated cart (including products, quantity, and total price), and a flag indicating if the product was previously purchased.
# If the process fails due to insufficient stock or other reasons, a detailed error message is returned, such as "Insufficient stock" or "No matching product found."
