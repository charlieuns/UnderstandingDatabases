# Query: Customer checks the current shopping cart contents and remove the lowest-priced item. And the total price of the cart is updated accordingly. A new order is then created based on the remaining items in the shopping cart, and payment is processed. 
# The order record is updated in the database, and the customer document is modified to reflect the new order and the cleared shopping cart. Additionally, inventory levels for the purchased items are adjusted to reflect the transaction.

# Query Description:
# This query processes a customer's shopping cart by performing several operations in sequence:

# Retrieve Shopping Cart Contents:
# The system retrieves the current contents of the shopping cart for a specific customer, including the list of products, their quantities, and the total price.

# Remove the Lowest-Priced Item:
# Among the items in the shopping cart, the product with the lowest total value (quantity Ã— price) is identified and removed.

# Update Shopping Cart Total:
# After removing the lowest-priced item, the total price of the shopping cart is recalculated and updated in the customer's record.

# Create a New Order:
# The remaining items in the shopping cart are used to create a new order. The order includes details such as the total price, the list of products, and the quantities ordered.
# A delivery partner is randomly assigned to the order, and the payment status is marked as "Paid."

# Record the Order in the Database:
# The newly created order is added to the PastOrders collection in MongoDB, maintaining a record of the transaction.

# Update Customer Document:
# The customer's document in the database is updated to reflect the transaction: The shopping cart is cleared. The new order is linked to the customer's list of orders.

# Adjust Inventory Levels:
# For each product in the new order, the system updates the inventory records to reduce the available stock by the quantity purchased.

# This query ensures that the customer's shopping cart, orders, and inventory levels are accurately updated in the database, providing a consistent and reliable transaction workflow.
